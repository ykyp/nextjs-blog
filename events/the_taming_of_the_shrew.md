#### A FEW WORDS ABOUT THE PLAY

Ancient Kourion to Host an Exhilarating Production of “The Taming of the Shrew”, directed by Penny Cook and presented by Performing Arts for Cyprus Charities.

Performing Arts for Cyprus Charities (PACC) is pleased to announce the return of Shakespeare at Kourion for the 61st year with William Shakespeare’s The Taming of the Shrew. Penny Cook, returns to Kourion after her 2021 directorial debut of a Merchant of Venice, to direct the 2023 production with a cast and crew of dedicated volunteers.

Ancient Kourion is set to come alive with the magic of Shakespeare’s timeless comedy as it hosts an unforgettable presentation of “The Taming of the Shrew”. Penny Cook, along with a stellar multinational cast of veteran Kourion performers and newcomers to the Kourion stage, bring this tale of love, wit and transformation alive on the breathtaking ancient stage. With it’s picturesque backdrop of ancient ruins, the venue offers a unique, evocative setting, adding to the magic and beauty of the tale.

“The Taming of the Shrew is a love story in an unconventional nature, Shakespeare allows us a chance to view the shifting gender dynamics through an almost farcical look at the conventions of the time. With the stunning background of ancient Kourion, and with a brilliant cast, we aim to transport the audience ιnto the world of Shakespeare’s characters and ignite their imagination” – Penny Cook, director

“Come on, and kiss me, Kate.” In order for the young Bianca to be married to one of her many suitors, her elder sister Katerina must get married first. However, can anyone match up to the brash, straight talking and strong willed Katherina? Petruchio has come to Padua looking for a wife (and a dowry) and thinks he is up for the challenge. So,
sets off a tale full of disguises, clashes and verbal sparring as well as love, understanding and compromise.
