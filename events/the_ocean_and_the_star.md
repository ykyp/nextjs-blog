#### SOME WORDS ABOUT THE PLAY

> 'Why do you humans never learn?'
> 'Maybe because the stars are just sitting there, watching it all.'

Written and directed by award-winning Cypriot playwright, Eleni Cosma, this captivating play delves into
the depths of pain, love, and the eternal quest for meaning. The company is made up of movement
director Natalie Jones (Central school of Speech and Drama), actors Jad Sayegh (East 15 Acting) and
Angelika Christoforou (NYU Tisch), and composer and vocal coach Phoebe Martin.	‘The Ocean and the
Star’ will be heading to the	Edinburgh Fringe Festival	(the world’s largest arts festival) dir	ectly after its
Cyprus premiere, for a 12 performance run from 4	th -15 th August (edfringe.com).

Haunted by the urgent need to share his story, a writer extends a bold invitation to a star, pleading for her guidance in crafting his work. Driven by his mortality, he implores the star to transcend the unwritten laws that bind her and join him on earth for just three nights. As they weave the fragments of the
writer's difficult tale, the	star’s emotional reactions cause her to slowly	unveil her own past as a human,
revealing a profound connection between the two of them. Their worlds collide, and as the writer
furiously seeks healing, the star is left to confront the deep scars left by her own humanity.

‘The Ocean and the Star’	skillfully delves into themes of resilience, redemption, and the complexities of
the human condition. It fearlessly tackles sensitive subjects, including rape, LGBTQ+ rights, and
reincarnation, offering a thought-provoking exploration of these crucial issues. Due to the nature of the
subject matter, the play is recommended for audiences aged 14 and above.
