World-renowed Italian opera star, Massimo Giordano, is coming for the first time to Cyprus with his program “Parlami d’amore” 🇮🇹

A soloist of the world’s most prestigious opera theaters, including the Metropolitan Opera (New York), La Scala (Milan), Opéra national de Paris (Paris) and Convent Garden (London), Giordano will perform arias from the golden era of composers such as Verdi, Puccini, Massenet, as well as famous Neapolitan songs “O sole mio”, “Funiculì, ‘funiculà”. Massimo is widely recognized as one of the greatest tenors of our time, with a voice that has been praised for its beauty, power, and emotional depth.

Joining Giordano onstage is the talented soprano Ester Kandinova. With her crystal-clear voice and stunning vocal range, she has captivated audiences across the world.
