#### A FEW WORDS ABOUT THE PLAY

Little Muse Theatre presents "The Lion The Witch & The Wardrobe", a theatrical play by C.S.Lewis, directed by Catherine Beger.

During the World War II bombings of London, four children are sent to a country house where they will be safe. One day Lucy finds a wardrobe that transports her to a magical world called Narnia.
