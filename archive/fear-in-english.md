#### A FEW WORDS ABOUT THE PLAY

Little Muse Youth Theatre presents "Fear", a theatrical play by Judith Johnson, directed by Catherine Beger.

Kal tells the story of a local house, said to be haunted by the ghost of a man who once lived there with his ageing mother and pet monkey. Kal challenges his friends to sneak into the haunted house where they find something terrifying in the upstairs bedroom...deliciously funny and scary!
